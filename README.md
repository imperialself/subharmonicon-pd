# subharmonicon-pd

This is a sequencer built on Pure Data, designed to control a synthesizer via MIDI. 

It's modelled somewhat after the Subharmonicon, however I've added some additional features 
such as extended scale quantization, and the ability to toggle between two sets of sequences.

You'll need to install Pure Data if you haven't already.

To launch, open subharmonicon_main.pd
